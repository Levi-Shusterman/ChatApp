# ChatApp2

Networked Chat Application

To run this application: Execute server.jar first, and then ChatGui.jar.
To change the IP and Port that the Client connects to, modify the class variables in ConnectManager.java.
The server runs on the local IP and always uses port 9090.


The Chat Clients and Server connect to each other using Socket
and ServerSocket on Localhost.
